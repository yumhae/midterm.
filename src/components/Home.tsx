              Ever since I was young, I have dreamed of becoming a civil engineer. However, fate led me to a different course one I never imagined taking. At first, I didn't like it, and I struggled because it wasn't something I truly wanted. But despite that, I chose to keep trying.

              They say, "Learn to love what you do, even if it's not what you dreamed of," because sometimes comfort and purpose come when you least expect them. I believe that if something is not meant for you, then it's not for you but if it is, no matter what happens, it will always find its way to you.
